## Description

These two sugar casters (*sucriers à poudre*) are of identical form, though their floral ornament differs. They are of baluster shape with a burnished circular foot ring. The body rises up from a base that evokes the underside of a corolla of flower petals, to narrow and then swell into a bulb shape before continuing upward as a slightly lobed cylinder. Four vertical scrolls spaced equidistant around the bulb accentuate its profile.[^3] A single plant stem grows along the face of each scroll and upward, adhering to the cylindrical body, to culminate in a full-blown flower head, in high relief, at the rim of the vessel. These stems also serve to disguise the solder seams that join the four separately cast parts of the body. Four additional single flower heads are soldered to the rim so that, all together, there is a wreath of eight blooms of differing varieties: rose, peony, ranunculus, dahlia, chrysanthemum, daffodil, daisy, and sunflower. True to nature, each blossom is unique and none repeats from one caster to the other ([cats. 5.1](#cat-5-1), [5.2](#cat-5-2)). The cylindrical lid continues the verticality of the baluster; its joint to the body is hidden by the floral wreath. The lid takes the form of two stacked wicker baskets—the upper one slightly smaller in diameter. Apertures in the wickerwork allow the sugar to be sprinkled (*saupoudroir*) or “cast” ([cat. 5.3](#cat-5-3)). The lower edge of each basket has a banded reed molding. At the crown of each upper basket is a sculptural arrangement of larger and smaller flower heads from among the list above, with the addition of poppy and a diminutive four-petal variety, perhaps aubrieta ([cat. 5.4](#cat-5-4)). Each lid secures to the body by two catch-latches that engage and disengage, through a twisting motion, with openings cut into the vessel rim (see [mark 5.2](#mark-5-2)).[^4]

## Commentary

The consumption of sugar in Europe grew as the demand, cultivation, processing, and importation of the commodity increased throughout the eighteenth century.[^5] By mid-century, French West Indies colonial plantations, particularly on the islands of the Antilles, Saint Domingue (modern-day Haiti), and Guadeloupe, were major sources of raw cane and its processed products of crystallized sugar, molasses (*mélasse*, or treacle), and brandy (*l’eau-de-vie des cannes*).[^6] Seven enlightening engravings designed by Louis-Jacques Goussier for the famed *Encyclopédie*, edited by Denis Diderot and Jean Le Rond d’Alembert, visualized a sugarcane plantation in the Antilles in the early 1760s as well as the refining processes that took place in its mill, boiling house, curing house, distillery, and storage.[^7]

Sugar was enjoyed across the French socioeconomic spectrum, from elite to modest households. It sweetened the naturally bitter beverages made from coffee, tea, and cacao; complemented some savory dishes; flavored fruit and desserts; and, when made into a paste and molded, formed sculptural table decorations. Quantities used by the royal kitchens at the Château de Versailles offer an accurate measure of consumption for a representative year. The kitchens ordered a total 8,539 pounds of sugar in 1785 (a year for which such documentation survives for the king’s household, or *la Maison du roi*).[^8] The combined tally reflected the available grades of the product: 3,748 pounds of “ordinary” crystalline, imperfectly refined sugar (“cassonnade blanche”); 3,103 pounds of partially cleaned and crystallized brown sugar (“cassonnade”); 996 pounds of “ordinary” sugar of the first grade (“cassonnade blanche, première sorte”); and 692 pounds of “royal” (“roial surfin”) or confectionary sugar.[^9] Specialty cookery books provided details about the grades of sugar, their preparation, and uses.[^10] By 1788, annual consumption in France averaged about two pounds per person, at a cost ranging between eleven and twenty-five *sous* a pound in Paris.[^11]

Refined crystallized sugar was shipped across the Atlantic packed in paper-wrapped, semihard cone shapes, known as sugar loaves (*pains de sucre*).[^12] Once brought into the domestic kitchen, the cone had to be broken down with a diminutive hammer or cut into small lumps with nippers. These smaller pieces generally accompanied the serving of coffee or tea, whose hot liquid readily dissolved them. Precious-metal thongs facilitated the handling of these lumps from open bowls of commensurately expensive silver or porcelain, as portrayed in the still life of a tea tray by Jean Étienne Liotard ([fig. 5.1](#fig-5-1)).[^13]

{% figure "fig-5-1" %}

Alternatively, shipments of semihard crystallized sugar arrived in France to be crushed into very small fine grains or powder at specialized refineries, notably those around the port city of Bordeaux, for use as a condiment during a meal.[^14] Two types of vessels served sugar in these forms: a caster with a pierced lid for sprinkling (*sucrier à poudre*) and a lidded bowl (the smaller *pot à sucre* or the larger *sucrier à poudre*) with an accompanying slotted or pierced spoon for dusting (*cuillère à saupoudrer*). Casters, as tablewares, were already in use by the mid-1600s for salt, ground pepper, spices, and dry mustard. With the broadening of sugar consumption in domestic settings, sugar casters were added to those commonly present on the table, and all of them usually stayed in placed for the entire repast, from the first course to the dessert course. During this last course, a dusting of fine grain or powdered sugar especially enhanced the flavor of fresh fruit. When a distinctly separate table setting of precious metal was laid for the dessert service, the wares, including the sugar casters, were often of gilded silver, perhaps to better show off the snowy whiteness of the refined sugar.

The most prevalent caster shape in use by the 1650s was a cylinder canister with a hinged or clasped pierced dome-shaped lid (*saupoudreuse à dôme*).[^15] This form was easy to grasp by hand while the number, size, and shape of the piercings controlled the flow of its dry contents.[^16] In more prosperous households, all the condiment containers were grouped on a table centerpiece (*surtout de table*). An engraving in the 1729 edition of the cookbook *Le nouveau cuisinier royal et bourgeois* by François Massialot illustrated this custom. The foldout image shows a table centerpiece designed as a low stand supporting assorted condiment vessels and a tureen (from which candle branches projected). The caption reads “Machine, autrement dit Surtout, pour server au milieu d’une grande Table, qu’on laisse pendant tous les Services” (“Machine, in other words a centerpiece, to serve in middle of a large table, which is left there during all the courses of the meal”).[^17] The two cylindrical casters are the tallest of the condiment vessel forms (see [fig. 8.1](#/catalogue/#fig-8-1)).

Casters were generally purchased in pairs, multiples, or sets, so that all diners could find one within reach on the table. The Massialot engraving clearly shows this multiplicity in a symmetrical arrangement. Eventually, differing shapes and heights among a group of casters gave visual clues to the content of each. Casters for sugar became taller than those for spices. Evolving fashion prompted variations in design, away from the utilitarian cylindrical canister type to a pear or baluster body shape ([fig. 5.2](#fig-5-2)).[^18] The pear shape emerged in the last decades of the 1600s, the baluster in the 1710s. A pair of casters from 1728–29 by Nicolas Besnier, the Parisian goldsmith to the king (*orfèvre du roi*), exemplify the baluster shape that prevailed at the beginning of independent rule by Louis XV. Aspects of its design and ornament (waterleaf and bead moldings, laurel leaves and flutes, and delicate piercing patterns) persisted into the 1740s ([fig. 5.3](#fig-5-3)).

{% figure "fig-5-3" %}

Stylistically, in shape and in ornament, the Getty casters by Parisian goldsmith Simon Gallien embody natural forms, in keeping with the principles of the alternative rocaille aesthetic. Each silver blossom is botanically identifiable and uniquely singular. The variety and individuality of each speaks of Gallien’s respect for the organic character of nature. In some crevices, among the flower petals, there is a granular surface quality that was not consistently chased or burnished away.[^19] This inconsistency may have been deliberate, perhaps to imbue a naturalism in defiance of the inorganic materiality of the precious metal. Simon’s younger relative, Jean Edme Gallien, the sculptor and merchant goldsmith (*marchand orfèvre*) who lived with him in the rue de Bussy, may have assisted in creating these flowers.[^20] Cleverly, Simon Gallien also employed these natural motifs to disguise the technical assembly of the vessels. The four vertical floral stems that travel upward along the baluster-shaped body actually hide the solder seams that join its four separately cast parts, while the wreath of floral blossoms at the vessel’s rim hides the joint of the body and lid. The casters are numbered underneath one and three, respectively, indicating they were once part of a set of three or more pieces. It is also possible that they were originally part of a multipiece table centerpiece, but no comparable companion pieces have been identified.

In contrast to the more common design for sugar bowls that took the form of sweet fruit, such as melons, Gallien’s casters effectively brought the flower garden indoors to remain ever fresh on the table.[^21] In this, he rivaled contemporary faience sugar casters with their opaque white tin glaze grounds and two-dimensional lush floral decoration painted in colorful enamels, by rendering his naturalistic blossoms in high relief, albeit of monochromatic silver. Like the faience sugar casters of the Paul Hannong manufactory in Strasbourg, whose white grounds mimicked refined white sugar and whose painted blooms evoked sweet fragrances, Gallien’s flowers added a tactical sweetness to match that of the palate ([fig. 5.4](#fig-5-4)).[^22]

## Notes

{% endbackmatter %}

[^1]: These notations record the weight for sugar caster “no. 1” in the old French units of *marc*, *once, gros*. The amount is equivalent to about 1,082.262 grams, which is about 39.826 grams (or 1 ozt., 5.60 dwt.) more than the actual overall weight for this caster and lid.

[^2]: These notations record the weight for caster “no. 3” in the old French units of *marc*, *once, gros*. The amount is equivalent to about 1,063.071 grams, which is about 44.961 grams (or 1 ozt., 8.90 dwt.) more than the actual overall weight for this caster and lid.

[^3]: Both sugar casters have very similar construction, though their surface texture varies slightly (see [note 19](#fn19) below). The vessels, especially, appear quite porous in the X-radiographs taken by Julie Wolfe, Decorative Arts and Sculpture Conservation, J. Paul Getty Museum. Each vessel is composed of five main parts that were soldered together: the open body (whose cylindrical form was assembled from four cast sections), a bottom plate disc of sheet metal, and a cast circular foot. Additionally, the rim of each vessel was made from hammered and cut sheet metal. Cast leafy stems were soldered over the four vertical joins of each vessel body. The array of naturalistic flowers, covering the vessel rim, were made with the repoussé technique and soldered in place. When the open back of a flower would be exposed above the rim, it was fitted with a covering of hammered and rounded sheet metal. Technical Report, November 23, 2021, by Julie Wolfe, Decorative Arts and Sculpture Conservation, J. Paul Getty Museum. X-radiographs were captured at 450 kV, 2mA, 1000 mSec, and 60 inches, with a GE X-radiography system with digital detector array. For further analytical information, see Appendix: Table 1.

[^4]: The lids appear to have been made from sections of sheet metal that were worked and then soldered together. The woven basket effect was created by chasing and piercing. The arrangement of flowers at the top was achieved with the repoussé technique. The sections were struck with the maker’s, warden’s, and discharge marks prior to piercing (see [mark 5.1](#mark-5-1)).

[^5]: The sugar economy of French and English slave-based plantations reached its apogee in the eighteenth century, as production and consumption crescendoed. See {% cite 'Mintz 1985' %}, 52–53.

[^6]: Cultivating cane and processing sugar was an arduous, labor-intensive, and dangerous operation. The true cost of the commodity cannot be factored on a financial basis alone, for sugar production in the West Indies was inexorably dependent on slave and indentured laborers. See {% cite 'Ponting 2000' %}, 510–13. The systemic use of black slave labor was already entrenched in the French Antilles colonial economy by the 1660s, when the engraver Sébastian Le Clerc published illustrations of slaves working the sugar plantations there.

[^19]: This granular quality, also known by the descriptive term “orange peel,” is an unusual surface to be found on worked, chased, and engraved silver. It was likely caused when the molten silver-copper alloy was overheated and oxygen was absorbed. As the molten alloy cooled, oxygen reacted with the copper to make cuprite, which expanded in volume, creating a bubbly surface. Overheated silver-copper alloys can also develop pinhole porosity when solidifying. See {% cite 'Scott 1991' %}, especially 31–32. Reference courtesy of Julie Wolfe, Decorative Arts and Sculpture Conservation, J.
