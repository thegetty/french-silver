## Description

This lozenge shape tray is supported by four low legs (alt plate 7a). The volutes at the base of each leg rise into a fan of paired leaves flanking a central budding stalk that stretches above the rim of the tray and over its banded reed molding.[^2] Ribbons bind the reeds, giving the illusion of tying them in place along the serpentine contours of the rim. The surface of the tray is flat-chased into compartments: a large central circle flanked by a pair of smaller circles and four irregularly shaped fields of waving flutes (alt plate 7b). The central circle contains a coat of arms tentatively identified as de Ménard de la Menardière, surmounted by a marquis’s coronet, set against a diaper pattern within an asymmetrical shield above crossed palm fronds and twigs of laurel. Each flanking circle is engraved with a geometric arrangement of four flattened acanthus leaves set around a central dot and encircled by a narrow ring.

## Commentary

This type of tray was intended to support a pair of lidded beakers, or *gobelets couverts*. Such trays were standard fixtures in the French eighteenth-century toilette set (*service de toilette*), which was an ensemble of implements used during the morning act of cleansing and grooming. As a ritualized process, it was known as *la* *levee.*[^3] Toilette sets served both men and women, though those for men featured a shaving basin. In prosperous high-ranking families, it was customary for a bride to receive a silver toilette service upon her marriage, for use and for display. Typically, a set composed a mirror, candlesticks, a tray with a candlesnuffer and wick trimmer, an ewer and basin, a tray with lidded beakers, brushes, a vessel for dental paste, pots for creams and cosmetics, and boxes of differing sizes for powder, accessories, jewelry, and pins. More extensive sets could include additional items such a water jug, scent bottles, a bell, a small spittoon, and even a warming pan.

Two extant Parisian silver toilette sets from the period exemplify the role of this type of tray and show the form of lidded beakers it supported. Contrary to previous scholarly interpretation, these vessels were not intended to contain face creams or cosmetics. The first toilette set contains nineteen pieces made in 1738-39 by Étienne Pollet, and four other silversmiths under his direction, for Henriette Julie Gabrielle de Lorraine, duchesse de Cadaval (fig. 7.1).[^4] It was not uncommon for a goldsmith to efficiently and quickly fill a commission by sub-contracting components of a large toilette set among several craftsmen, all working towards a unified design. For the Cadaval toilette set, the tray and pair of lidded beakers were made by Antoine Le Brun (fig. 7.2). In archival documents concerning the commission, the tray was called a “saucer or glove tray” (*soucoupe ou gantière*) and the lidded beakers were called “covered goblets” (*gobelets avec leurs couvercles*).[^5] Though the old-fashioned etiquette of having a tray to pass or to receive *les honneurs*, or gloves, was less commonly observed by mid-century, new commissions by aristocratic households still included the item.[^6] The function of the Getty tray, however, aligned more closely with the role of a saucer, as it was intended to carry a pair of little drinking cups for cold beverages.[^7] The oblong shape of the tray and the narrow form of the beakers endured for decades. It was the tray’s single oval foot that evolved, as demonstrated by the second comparative toilette set.

\[fig. 7.2 – trays with beakers, from Detroit Institute of Art online collection page, 53.186.2\]

The second comparable toilette set dates from ten years later and, while now incomplete, all ten surviving pieces were made by one goldsmith, Jean Charles Fauché (fig. 7.3).[^8] Its tray is quite similar in shape to the Cadaval one except that it has four volute shape feet rather than a singular foot ring and, in this detail, it reflects a new development in design. It follows the precedent of the tray in the gilded-silver toilette set delivered in 1746 by Thomas Germain for the French dauphine Marie Thérèse Raphaëlle d’Espagne. That tray was of lozenge shape, supported by four volute shape feet (albeit, positioned at the cardinal points). The dauphine’s service does not survive but seven related drawings, done to scale, are preserved including one for the *gantière* with two *gobelets* *couverts*.[^9] Given the prestige of the dauphine’s set, no doubt its design features became common knowledge among the tight community of Parisian goldsmiths eager to keep up with fashion (fig. 7.4).

\[fig. 7.4 - drawing, private collector, Paris\]

The Getty tray, made by the son of Thomas Germain some four to five years after the dauphine’s one, corresponds in several key features to the latter’s drawn rendering, namely in size, shape, and flat chasing.[^10] First of all, the tray’s actual dimensions match almost precisely those of the two-dimensional views, which measure from guilloche border to guilloche border (excluding the maximum bulk of the flowers) 3.6 x 21 x 18.7 centimeters (height x length x width). Secondly, the volute shape feet and their positions align, in relation to the orientation of the lozenge shape tray. Thirdly, the compartmentalization of the trays’ surfaces and flat chased ornament are comparable. It is clear that François Thomas Germain had access to the drawing (and perhaps to molds for the volute shape feet), which was preserved after his father’s death. For the 1750 commission, however, he simplified the overall appearance of its tray, eliminating the profusion of flowers and substituting a banded reed molding for the tray rim.

The center of the Getty tray is engraved with the coat of arms of, possibly, the de Ménard de la Menardière family.[^11] Thanks to the presence of this armorial engraved on related pieces, it is possible to identify four lidded boxes, or *boîtes de toilette ronde*, from this dispersed toilette set. The largest box (8.3 x 13.8 cm) is in the in the Musée des arts décoratifs, Paris (fig. 7.5).[^12] A smaller pair (5.5 x 8.5 cm) of the same form, called *boîtes à mouche* (which were containers for fashionable, small black patches usually applied to the face)*,* passed through the French art market in 1996.[^13] These three still bear the family’s arms while the fourth (6 x 9 cm) has a heavily over-engraved sunflower obliterating the arms.[^14] All four are stamped with the Paris warden’s mark “K” (used under Julien Berthe between July 15, 1750 and January 22, 1752), meaning that they were produced as a group simultaneously with the tray in the workshop of François Thomas Germain.[^15] The boxes are of rounded octagonal shape, with four vertical console-bracketed segments spaced equidistant around each vessel. Chased floral swags link one console to the next. The base of each vessel and its lid follow the same rounded octagonal contour. Their banded reed moldings echo that of the tray.

If the lidded beakers (*gobelets couverts*) survive for the Getty tray, perhaps they would also follow the model in Thomas Germain’s drawing for the 1746 dauphine’s service, but simplified and updated with a banded reed molding. That was the design solution François Thomas German chose just a few years later in 1755 for the lidded beakers he delivered with another gilded-silver toilette set.[^16] Curiously, he took a different approach with that tray, reverting back to the traditional oblong shape that prevailed in the 1730-40s. He modernized its appearance, though, by chasing large palmettes at either end.

\[fig. 7.5 – lidded box from toilette service, Musée des Arts décoratifs, Paris, inv. 26910\]

In summary, five pieces from the original toilette set are known: one tray, the Getty’s, and four lidded boxes. The other elements of the set have not been identified so their number and appearance can only be surmised (as above). Certainly, as a creation of the king’s famous sculptor-goldsmith (*sculpteur-orfèvre du roi*) François Thomas Germain, the set was an expensive and prestigious commission but possibly not executed originally for the de Ménard de la Menardière family. This hypothesis is based on an engraved design for a tray, published by Pierre Germain in 1748, that offers alternative decorative treatments for two quadrants, one of which is closely similar the Getty tray. The armorial in the design incorporates a pair of shields, above palm fronds and below a crown.[^17] Did aesthetic merits preserve the original toilette set from the crown’s 1759 order to melt silver in order to defray the cost of the Seven Years War?[^18] Marks on the extant tray and four boxes indicate they were exported from France between 1762 (if not before) and 1774 and imported back into France between 1838 and 1864.[^19] Some scholars conclude, therefore, the French armorials for the de Ménard de la Menardière family were added between 1838 and 1887.[^20]

## Notes

[^1]: The research of Michèle Bimbenet-Privat has revealed that the discharge mark of the cow actually came into use long before 1762, probably as early as 1733. Information courtesy of an electronic communication received from Michèle Bimbenet-Privat in August 2021.

Paul Getty Museum, and her interpretation of x-radiographs taken at 450 kV, 2mA, 500 mSec, and 60 inches, with a GE x-radiography system improve our understanding of how this object was made. It appears the flat tray itself was cast and not hammered from sheet metal. Its upward curving edge, apparently, was raised by hand from the perimeter of the cast tray. This edge, in turn, was hidden under a cast lozenge shape ring, including the banded reed molding and the four budding stalks, which was soldered into place. Each leg, from its volute shape base upward to its scroll and cartouche shape top, was hollow cast and soldered to the underside of the tray (see alt plate 7a). The thickness of the cast tray thins at the center of the lozenge, in the area of the engraved armorial. This suggests a prior alteration to that surface ornament.

    (accessed 2020-03-24)\] This set is contemporary with the designs for silver published in 1748 by the goldsmith Pierre Germain.

[^9]: After the untimely death of the first dauphine, this set was adapted and expanded by Thomas Germain for the second dauphine Marie-Josèphe de Saxe, who married Louis, dauphin de France, in 1747. The descriptive title “*gantière avec deux gobelets couverts”* derives from the list made by the goldsmith Roëttiers in December 1768, when he was tasked with restoring the service after the death of dauphine Marie Josèphe de Saxe.

[^11]: This identification is not certain as the field of the de Ménard de la Menardière family’s coat of arms should be silver (represented in heraldic tincture as a white, or plain, field without hatching) whereas the engraved armorial shows it as blue (with horizontal hatching). Likewise, the engraved armorial does not correctly indicate the red color of the heraldic lion. Did the engraver accurately render his patron’s arms, make an error, or take artistic liberty? {{Rietstap 1887 (reprint edition 1965)}}, vol. 2, 197. {{Rolland 1967}}, vol. 3, plate CLXXXIV. {{Jougla de Morénas 1975}}, vol. 5, Mar-Ric, 37.
