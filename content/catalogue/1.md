## Object Description

This pair of oval tureens, with liners and stands, is characterized by their distinctive boar heads and hooves.

{{< q-figure id="gm_007017F1V1" >}}

Each tureen has a slightly bulging convex lower body that rises into a concave curve before reaching the rim with its banded reed molding. The body is supported by four legs positioned at the cardinal points. The sculptural ornament is symmetrical. A highly naturalistic boar's head projects from the narrow end of each tureen. Each head is cast nearly in the round, with upper and lower tusks flaring out the open jaw and around the snout. The top of the head and ears rise above the rim. Coarse hair bristles from cheek to chest, which merges into the vessel's body, and continues down the creature's leg to its cloven hoof, which becomes one of the vessel's supports. The bottom of the vessel is chased with coarsely-textured hair in an abstracted imitation of the boar's belly (a feature that can be readily observed when the tureen rests on the reflective surface of the stand). Burnished scrolls separate the animal's form the vessel's plain lower body. A substantial volute supports the vessel at the center of each long side. Adorned with imbricated dimpled discs on its front, it rises up the swelling body to bear an armorial cartouche. The oval shield carries the arms of the Portuguese family, Melo e Castro, beneath a ducal coronet. Applied husk festoons and meandering ribbons spread laterally. The liner of each tureen snugly fits into the well of vessel. Its plain surface rises to meet the back of the boar's head. There, the rim of liner extends upward into a burnished scroll, amidst which are chased tufts of boar hair. Below, in low relief, a stylized half-shell motif adorns the interior of the liner.

{{< q-figure-group id="gm_006587D3V1, gm_006587F7V1, gm_006587F11V1" grid="1" >}}

The shaped oval stand has a banded reed molding along its rim. Symmetrical curving scrolls and foliates articulate the cardinal points of its rim, each marked by either an oval, radiated disc or a quatrefoil clasp. A flat chased border follows the contour of the trim. It contains chased branches of berried laurel and irregularly-shaped gadrooned segments. The plain central surface of the stand is engraved with the coat of arms of the Melo e Castro family, above crossed palm branches, flanked by a husk festoons, and surmounted by a ducal coronet and the family crest of an eagle with spread wings, all within tied laurel branches.

## Commentary

Traditionally, at the highest end of design and execution, centerpieces (*surtouts du table*), tureens (oval *terrines* and round *pots à oille*), condiment vessels for salt, pepper, mustard (*salière, poivrière, moutardier*), and candelabra (*candélabres* and *girandoles*) were the most sculptural vessels presented on the dining table for they were works in the round. Their fabrication required sophisticated skills beyond those needed to make the shallower forms of trays, salvers, dishes, bowls, and cutlery. As an experienced sculptor, bronze castor, and gold/silversmith, Thomas Germain excelled in creating astonishing and inventive three-dimensional table wares whose forms and ornament played upon the allied themes of food procurement and cookery: hunting, fishing, vegetable gardening, fruit cultivation, and mushroom picking. The fame of his talent grew after his appointment as gold/silversmith-sculptor to the king (*orfèvre-sculpteur du roi*) in September 1723. Made in 1726-1729, this pair of tureens, with boar heads, is his earliest extant commission in this genre preserved in a public collection.

Originally, these tureens had lids elaborately formed as sculptural still life tableaux of game and vegetables. These disappeared in the early nineteenth century but their weight can be calculated to approximately 3,134 grams each, which is consistent with an elaborate assembly of cast elements. [^1] [confirm wording with conservator] Essential elements of their ornament were recorded in two inventory descriptions from the eighteenth century (see below). They bore trophies of animals, birds, and crustaceans, with a cauliflower on one and an artichoke on the other (further discussed below). Their ornament of game, shellfish, and foodstuffs evoked the possible ingredients that would have been contained in the vessel.[^2] The French term for this shape of vessel was *terrine*, a type traditionally used to serve a slow-simmered pungent stew, or *ragoût*. The recipe was hearty, calling for meat, vegetables, and seasonings. Normally, such vessels and their lids had clearly-defined handles to facilitate serving but these did not.[^3]

In his seminal article of 1990, Bruno Pons first identified this pair of tureens as that delivered by Thomas Germain to Jacques Samuel Bernard, future comte de Coubert, at his Parisian townhouse, located at 46 rue du Bac, on the left bank of the Seine just south of the Galeries du Louvre where Germain lived.[^4] Eldest son of the vastly wealthy banker Samuel Bernard, Jacques Samuel pursued a career in law with the Parlement de Paris before acquiring in 1725 the post of financial superintendent of the queen's household (*surintendant des finances de la Maison de la Reine*). Perhaps arriving at this elevated position prompted him to order new silver vessels from the same court gold/silversmith-sculptor who in 1726, supplied a large gold toilette service of thirty-five pieces to his patroness, Marie Leczinska, queen of France.[^5] Date marks on the boar head tureens correspond to the years 1726-1729 and support this hypothesis.

When delivered in 1729, the tureens had remarkable lids whose ornament complemented the boar heads on the vessels. The inventory compiled on August 13, 1753 following the death of Jacques Samuel Bernard, described them as:

> Silver Plate. N^o^ 802: Two large tureens supported by wild boars. On the covers are different animals and fruits. Two large oval dishes with chased contours serve [as stands] for the tureens. Two large spoons for these.[^6]

The 1796 posthumous inventory of their subsequent owner, Martinho de Melo e Castro gave further details about the tureens with boar heads (*cabeças de javalis*). Their lids were topped with an artichoke on one of them, and on the other a cauliflower, and all were decorated with birds, seafood and crayfish.[^7]

In subject, the game theme of Jacques Samuel Bernard's tureens coincided with this father's own passion for the hunt as expressed by the elder Bernard's parallel commission to the Germain workshop for an ambitious and astounding table centerpiece in silver. Though not yet completed by the death of Samuel Bernard in 1739 nor by the death Thomas Germain himself in 1748, its final composition was achieved by Francois-Thomas Germain. The massive piece consisted of a stand, a tiered tray set with two greyhounds, furling foliage, a hunting horn, dead game and sliced sausage, all rising to support a covered urn whose lid bears three putti, cavorting with stars, and two twiggy branches that transform into candelabra (stars and greyhounds, or *levrettes*, were heraldic symbols of the comtes de Coubert). This tour-de-force never graced the Bernard household as payment remained outstanding upon the death of Jacques Samuel in 1753 and so it remained in the Germain workshop.[^8] In 1757, François Thomas Germain finished and sold the piece to a Portuguese client, the eighth duque d'Aveiro, who was forced to relinquish it to his king, José I.[^9]

{{< q-figure id="centromesa_final" >}}

The over-arching theme of the hunt played into a major plan to aggrandize Jacques Samuel Bernard's residence in the rue de Bac. That plan ultimately provided a harmonious context for his growing collection of silver table wares in general and the boar head tureens and their lids in particular. Having purchased an adjoining townhouse on the rue Saint-Dominique, Jacques Samuel initiated a project in 1730 to join it to his existing residence and, in so doing, create a new grand salon and gallery off the garden. The new salon was intended to also serve as a dining room; it was fitted with fine paneling (carved with allegorical figures), large mirrors, and two large still-life paintings by Jean-Baptiste Oudry of outdoor scenes with hunting dogs, water fowl, and exotic birds.[^10] The subjects of Oudry's paintings complemented the ornament of Germain's tureens.[^11]

Once the decoration of the grand salon was fully achieved around 1740-1742, Bernard commissioned more serving vessels from Thomas Germain. This time he ordered a pair of round tureens (*pots à oille*), whose lids bear crayfish and artichokes in allusion to the ingredients of the Spanish recipe for *olio*.[^12] When laid for the first course, the Bernard dining table must have resembled the engraved arrangement titled *Table de quinze ou seize Couverts* ("Table of fifteen or sixteen Place Settings") that accompanied the 1742 cookbook, *Le cuisinier moderne*, by Vincent La Chapelle.[^13] This two-dimensional rendering clearly distinguished the sculptural forms of the *terrines* and *pots à oille* from the shallower dishes and plates. The absence of a centerpiece (*surtout de table*) in this engraving is striking, the more so since Bernard's own dining table lacked its centerpiece by Germain.

{{< q-figure id="15907529716_e2b8942563_k" >}}

Thomas Germain made a nearly identical second pair of boar head tureens in 1733-1734 for Henry Janssen, a naturalized Englishman living in Paris. They survive with their lids; one is in the Detroit Institute of Arts and the other is in a private collection. The lid of the former is decorated with a rabbit, a crayfish, oysters on the half-shell, artichokes, leafy greens, and a mushroom. The lid of the latter has a snipe, a cauliflower, an onion, an open pea pod, a turnip, and mushrooms.[^14] Their appearance gives the closest possible visualization of the lids lost from the Getty pair. One notable distinction, however, concerns the boar leg supports on the Janssen tureens; each support consists of two boar legs and hooves, paired side-by-side. In this regard, they differ from the Bernard/Getty versions, whose supports each have only one boar leg and hoof. Paired boar leg supports are clearly visible in the still life of a boar head tureen, filled with peaches, painted by 1739-1740 by François Desportes, a neighbor of the Germain family in the Galeries du Louvre. The painting was brought to Stockholm around 1739-1741 by the Swedish diplomat and art collector, Carl Gustav Tessin.[^15]

Sometime after the death of Jacques Samuel Bernard in 1753 and the protracted settlement of his estate which had outstanding debts, François Thomas Germain acquired the Bernard pairs of boar head tureens and *pots à oille*. He, in turn, sold both pairs in 1764 to [Martinho de Melo e Castro](https://www.getty.edu/art/collection/search/?provenance.id=23371), changing their armorials accordingly and engraving his signature on the stands. [^16] Melo e Castro was the Portuguese representative at the peace negotiations to end the Seven Years War. The first phrase of negotiations was held in Fontainebleau in 1762 and the second phase in Paris in 1763. While in Paris, Melo e Castro resided for a few months in 1761, coincidentally, at the prestigious address of 46 rue du Bac, as had his predecessor in the proceedings, the Portuguese abbot Salema.[^17] Melo e Castro bought the tureens and other silver to grace his table as befitting his stature as the Portuguese ambassador to France. The tureens remained in his possession until the end of his life and were listed in his posthumous inventory of September 14, 1796.[^18]

In terms of design and execution, drawings and documents shed light on Thomas Germain's inventive creation of the boar head tureen model. Peter Fuhring analyzed his extant working drawings for tureens, to reveal his design process. Aspects of one design in particular, dated to around 1725-1730, evolved and took on three-dimensional form. The vessel in the sanguine drawing has a cow's head under each handle. The chest, leg, and hoof of each merge to become the lateral supports for the tureen, in a manner analogous to the boar version. Moreover, the central support of the drawn vessel parallels those on the actual Bernard tureens, in that the drawn volute support, adorned with imbricated fleurons, rises up to carry the armorial shield.[^19] Another drawing attributed to Thomas Germain shows designs for ten table wares arranged on a single sheet.[^20] It is a working drawing, of pen and wash, with linear markings at the bottom left corner to indicate the incremental measurement of twelve *pouces* (equivalent to 32.4cm / 12 ¾ in.). Each vessel's relevant measurements are also indicted, with the exception of the most detailed of the renderings. That portrays a lidded boar head tureen very much like the Jenssen version of 1733-1734. Meanwhile, the inventory of François Thomas Germain's premises taken in May-June 1765 lists models in lead from which the tureens were made for *M[onsieur] de Janssin* [sic]. Clearly the models dated to the era of his father and had remained in the workshop after his death in 1748. Given the close similarity of the 1733-1734 Janssen tureens to the 1726-1729 Bernard versions, it is probable some of these models were originally created for the earlier commission: "4 boar feet, 2 boar head, 1 end knot and lid, 1 handle [knot] at back of the liner, the bundle of herbs on top of the lid and among the vegetables." Lastly, among the models listed for coat of arms, monograms, and escutcheons there was a lead "group of branches and palms and an eagle, attributes of the arms Mello" which were created in 1764 on the occasion when Martinho Melo e Castro purchased both the *terrines* and the *pots à oille*.[^21]

## Notes

[^1]: Luis Keil surmised the lids were lost when the Portuguese court fled in exile to Brazil rather during the 1807 occupation of Portugal by French troops. Every inventory of the Melo e Castro family, as the condes das Galveias, after 1796 identified the lidless tureens as jardiniers or flower boxes (*jardineiras* or *floreiras*). {{Lisbon 1934}}, *Catalogo da Exposição de obras de Arte Francesas existentes em Portugal, V. I Ourivesaria do Século XVIII* exh. cat. (Lisbon: Museu Nacional de Arte Antigua, 1934), p. 82. Indeed, the vessels were still called jardiniers when sold by Christie's (International) S.

Henry Janssen, who from 1738 rented the Hôtel de Lassay, located at 140 rue du Bac, is thought to have been the original owner before they passed into the possession of the comte d'Eu and then the duc de Penthièvre, as succinctly summarized in Sotheby's, London. {{*Treasures* 2016}}, July 6, 2016, 132-41, lot 25, "A French Royal Silver Tureen and Cover form the Penthièvre-Orléans Service, The Cover, Antoine Sebastien Durant, Paris 1752-1753, The Tureen, Jean-Baptiste Claude Odiot, Paris, Circa 1821."
